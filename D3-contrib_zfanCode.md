## Retrospective
### what went well this deliverable
- Both teamates are responsible for the project. A good cooperation. 

### what went poorly
- Insufficent information for implementing the REST Endpoints; no heuristic provided
- Only two weeks to implement while both of us had many midterms


### how you will approach the next deliverable differently
- Start early.
