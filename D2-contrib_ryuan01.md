## Retrospective
### what went well this deliverable
- Although we didn't start early, we planned out how we want to do this and it really helped
- we had extra time due to the spring break, so that also helped
- knowing the hints for what to do after parse5 (the hint about depth first search in piazza) really helped

###what went poorly
- I should refactor my codes if I had extra time, and actually go through the design phase
- sometimes it's hard to determine where to change in the code due to the lack of documentations

### how you will approach the next deliverable differently
- Still keep to planning things out
- Documentation is important
