## Retrospective
### what went well this deliverable
- I enjoyed working with my teammate
- We started early
- Piazza is very helpful

###what went poorly
- I should have planned out what I want to code before I started coding, it will save me a lot more time. Alex did that, and his code worked right away.

### how you will approach the next deliverable differently
- Planning out and writing out the pseudocode before hand, so if something goes wrong, I will know where exactly to go look for them, and I won't write a lot of repeating codes.
