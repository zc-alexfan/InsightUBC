## Retrospective
### what went well this deliverable
- I got to run Autobot a lot more often, not sure if this is a feature/bug

###what went poorly
- I should have started earlier, but didn't really have time due to mideterms
- I should have planned out and thought about edge cases before I started coding. For example, I found out that group and apply can have extra terms comparing to terms in columns way afterwards...

### how you will approach the next deliverable differently
- Really think about edge cases before starting to code, so I can save myself some time and headache
- Hopefully start earlier too
