## Retrospective
### what went well this deliverable
- My partner is very understanding, thanks! I missed a few milestones which we set up, but Alex was understanding and supportive.

###what went poorly
- I should start earlier, UI was harder than I thought
- I should consulted with TA earlier about what kind of UI was required, so I could have avoided the mistake of separating into tasks.

### how you will approach the next deliverable differently
- Start early, I think the key is to work on this a bit at a time, even though I may not do much every day, it is still better than rushing everything at the end
